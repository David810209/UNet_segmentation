# UNet Semantic Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project implements a powerful UNet-based deep learning model for image segmentation, particularly semantic segmentation tasks. The model is designed to achieve high accuracy with robust performance on a wide variety of datasets. Key features include data preprocessing, model training, and result evaluation modules.

## Installation
To set up the environment for running this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/UNet_segmentation.git
   cd UNet_segmentation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files:

- **unet_utils.py**: 
  - Contains utility functions for building and modifying the UNet architecture.
  - Includes helper functions for training such as data loading and augmentation.

- **train.py**: 
  - Implements the core logic for training the UNet model.
  - Supports loading data, setting up training configurations, and monitoring progress.

- **preprocess.py**: 
  - Handles the preprocessing of input images and labels.
  - Performs normalization, resizing, and optional data augmentation.

- **result.py**: 
  - Evaluates the model's performance on test data.
  - Provides various metrics and visualization tools to analyze segmentation results.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training, ensure that your dataset is structured and preprocessed properly:
- Run `preprocess.py` to convert raw images into a usable format.
- The script supports normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness.
- put raw data in `dataset` folder

```bash
python preprocess.py 
```

## Training the Model
To start training the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py 
```
You can adjust the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate tfor optimal performance on your dataset.

## Evaluating Results
After training, evaluate the model using `result.py`:

```bash
python result.py 
```
This script will generate segmentation masks for the test images and compute evaluation metrics such as IoU and Dice coefficient.
